# Mapping Historical Los Angeles

This notebook begins the process of mapping historical Los Angeles. It does so by using a historical dataset developed by Ethington, Kooistra and DeYoung, scholars from the University of Southern California in 2000. 

Here, we will import the data and utilize data science methods to explore, filter, and visualize the data *spatially*.
